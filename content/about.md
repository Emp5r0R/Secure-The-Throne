I'm Emp5r0R, and I'm into space and cybersecurity. This website? It's my way of sharing all the cool stuff that sparks my curiosity. Ethical hacking isn’t just a skill for me—it’s a mindset. I believe in using my knowledge to learn and explore. You'll often find me on platforms like Hack The Box and Try Hack Me, getting my hands dirty and having fun.

Don't forget to [visit](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1652264") me on Hack The Box.

I’ve also built a hash cracker that rivals Hashcat in speed. While it currently supports fewer hashing algorithms, I’m actively improving it—stay tuned!
