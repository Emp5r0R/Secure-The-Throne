I'm Emp5r0R, and I'm really into space and cybersecurity. This website? It's my way of sharing all the cool stuff that sparks my curiosity. I'm a big believer in ethical hacking â€“ it's how I learn and explore. You'll often find me on platforms like Hack The Box and Try Hack Me, getting my hands dirty and having fun.

Don't forget to [visit](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1652264") me on Hack The Box.

Also I built this tool, a hash cracker which can rival even hashcat in terms of speed. Although it supports way less hashing algorithms for now, worry not I will keep on improving the tool.
